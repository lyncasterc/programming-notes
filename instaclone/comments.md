- comments belong to a post and a user (author). 
- posts and users can have many comments. comments can only have one post and one author.
- comments also have one optional parent comment.
	- a comment is either a parent (root) comment or a child to one.
- replies to comments that aren't parents aren't actually "replies". no need to keep track of replies in database
	- only ever one level of nested comments. parent -> children
- when a parent comment is deleted, their replies (all children comments) are deleted.
- when a post is deleted, all its comments are deleted
